## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Internet connection (for weather API calls)

### Installation & Running

1. Clone or navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```
4. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:8080`

### Usage

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Home page with weather form
- `POST /weather` - Submit location and get weather data

## Key Changes from JavaScript Version

### What was simplified:

‚úÖ **Eliminated all client-side JavaScript** - No more complex DOM manipulation or AJAX calls
‚úÖ **Server-side data processing** - Weather API calls now handled by Go backend  
‚úÖ **HTML form submission** - Simple POST request instead of JavaScript event handlers
‚úÖ **Template-based rendering** - Server generates complete HTML with data
‚úÖ **Embedded SVG icons** - Icons served directly from Go instead of separate JS file

### Architecture improvements:

- **Single-page application** ‚Üí **Traditional web app** with form submissions
- **Client-side API calls** ‚Üí **Server-side API integration**
- **3 separate files** (HTML/CSS/JS) ‚Üí **2 Go files** with embedded templates
- **Runtime DOM updates** ‚Üí **Server-side template rendering**

## Error Handling

The application handles various error scenarios:
- Invalid location names
- API service unavailable
- Network connectivity issues
- Malformed API responses

## Performance & Reliability

- Server-side caching opportunities (can be added)
- Reduced client-side complexity
- Better SEO compatibility
- Works without JavaScript enabled
- Lower bandwidth usage (no separate JS/CSS files)

## Development

To modify the application:

- **UI/Styling**: Edit the HTML template in `main.go` (renderTemplate function)
- **Weather Logic**: Modify handlers in `main.go`
- **Icons**: Update SVG definitions in `icons.go`
- **Dependencies**: Modify `go.mod`
